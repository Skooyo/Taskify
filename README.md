Team Definition of Done:

1. Feature added meets all of the requirements written in the user story.
2. Adequate documentation to allow other developers to understand the piece of code that was created for the feature.
3. QA testing to ensure that the features function as per the client’s request, is able to be integrated with the rest of the application’s features, and is a complete feature (not a singular html element with no functionalities).
4. Peer review to check if the code was implemented correctly and functionality testing by peers to ensure the correctness of the feature added.
5. Code does not break github deployment on Vercel, ensures good coding practices that adheres to Vercel’s standards.
6. Meets extra acceptance criteria that is unique to each user story (if there are any extra acceptance criteria).

Team Git Policy:
1. Team members should utilize git branches to minimize git conflicts, when adding a new feature, create a new branch with a name that is self-explanatory (i.e. when developing task cards, create a new branch named taskCards).
2. When committing changes, ensure that adequate explanation is given in the commit messages (i.e. “Feature - Finished creating task cards” or “Bugfix - Fixed data not loading on task cards”). Avoid lengthy explanations, make sure it is clear and concise.
3. Regularly check on the project version, ensure that you are working on the latest version of the project to avoid conflicts.
4. Ensure that peer reviews are done before merging your commits to main via pull requests, avoid directly pushing your changes to the main branch (unless necessary). Remember to merge pull requests if it has been approved by other team members.
